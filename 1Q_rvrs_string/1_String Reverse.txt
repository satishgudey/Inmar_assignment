1. Write a program to reverse a string “abcdef” --> “fedcba”  (preferably NOT using inbuilt functions that come along with the libraries. We want to understand how you would think algorithm wise?

Note : The below algorithm is written in cobol program not just for fixed or static values, it was written multiple values whenever it changes.

COBOL:

a. Read the variable using Inspect verb and "Length Off" by "-1" to new variable, this loop should read (-1) until the length is equal to actual length of the variable.
b. Now read new variable for leading spaces using Inspect verb.
c. Now SUB length of Input variable - length spaces countn from step 2, will gives us the actual length.
d. Now use Reference Modification, we can get the actual length and we can display the same. 

Python code using indexes:
a='abcdef'
print(a[::-1]):
